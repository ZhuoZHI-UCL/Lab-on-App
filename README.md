##Introduction of the project
###1.Background of the anemia

Anaemia is a serious global public health problem that particularly affects young children and
pregnant women. WHO estimates that 42% of children less than 5 years of age and 40% of
pregnant women and 20% of the older Population worldwide are anaemic.

Most commonly, people with anemia report feelings of weakness or fatigue, and sometimes
poor concentration. They may also report shortness of breath on exertion. In very severe anemia,
The patient may have symptoms related to this, such as palpitations, angina (if pre-existing heart
disease is present), intermittent claudication of the legs, and symptoms of heart failure.

Therefore, the diagnosis of anemia and its causes is important for improving human well-being.

###2.Problems existing in traditional anemia detection methods

Anaemia, defined as reduced haemoglobin concentration. The diagnosis of anemia in men is based
on a hemoglobin of less than 130 to 140 g/L (13 to 14 g/dL). In women, it is less than 120 to 130
g/L (12 to 13 g/dL). The traditional diagnosis of anaemia requires laboratory-based measurements
of a venous blood sample, which could bring trauma and pain to patients, even wound infection.
The diagnosis process involves complex equipment which requires professional operators and fixed
test site. To address these issues, researchers keep looking for novel anemia detection methods.

###3.Problems existing in novel anemia detection methods

Novel anemia detection methods based on AI data analysis and advanced sensing technology. For
the first part, the ML/DL models can be built for classifying patients’ finger nail, fundu, conjuctival
or other bio-images into anemia and normal condition. However, these models are not able to
give the cause of the anemia or predict the anemia in a early stage. At the same time, the
privacy protection agreement and time/labor cost make it difficult to collect biometric images of
patients at scale, which limits the performance of models. For the second part, researchers have
developed sensors based on the principle of multispectral analysis, transmission spectrum analysis,
etc. Similarly, these methods can not explain the reason of the anemia and it is unable to iterate
and update the algorithm with new biomarks.

###4.What do we want to achieve?

We would like to develop a Lab-on-App to non-invasively diagnose anaemia and its causes (e.g.
genetics, diet, or injury) that can be easily used by older people, carers, or healthcare professionals.
It is a system with portable device and corresponding software deployment. It is anticipated that
the successful demonstration of our proposed Lab-on-App will lead to additional work by this team
using mobile health technology to diagnose other conditions afflicting older population (kidney
diseases, colon diseases, or vitamin deficiencies).
